    "It needs to be emphasized that the specification search was not necessarily exhaustive and improvements to the final preferred model specifications are possible. The example describes the basis for the decisions made at each point in the model specification search process. Clearly, different decisions could be made at some of these points. Thus, the final model result is based on a complex mix of empirical results, statistical analysis and judgment. The challenge to the analyst is to make good judgments, describe the basis for the judgments made, and be prepared to demonstrate the implications of making different judgments."
