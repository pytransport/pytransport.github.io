Quick Start
================

If you're impatient and just want to get going, follow these instructions.

1.  Download and run the Python 3.7 installer for your computer from `Anaconda.com <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`_.
    Install for the current user only, which does not require administrator permissions.

2.  Open "Anaconda Prompt" (Windows) or the Terminal (Linux/MacOS) and enter this command to
    set up a working environment to use with this tutorial:

    .. code-block:: console

        conda env create camsys/tt

3.  Open "Anaconda Prompt" (Windows) or the Terminal (Linux/MacOS) and enter these two commands
    to start up *Jupyter Notebook*:

    .. code-block:: console

        conda activate tt
        jupyter notebook

    Alternatively, if you prefer the *JupyterLab* interface:
	
    .. code-block:: console

        conda activate tt
        jupyter lab


Only *Step 3* is required for subsequent sessions on the same computer.

What's the difference between *Jupyter Notebook* and *JupyterLab*?  Both provide a
web-based interactive environment for Python (and a few other languages, but mostly
Python).  The *Notebook* has more limited capabilities, tightly focused on using
one notebook at a time.  *JupyterLab* has a more modular approach, where you can open
several notebooks or other related files as tabs in the same window. It offers more
of an IDE-like experience, but may be a little slower to work with, especially if
you create large notebooks with a lot of interactive components.


Troubleshooting
---------------

**I got a `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import the `transportation_tutorials` package.**

The quick start instructions above will sometimes fail to install the transportation_tutorials
package correctly.  If you get this error, you can try re-installing the module using `pip`:

.. code-block:: console

    conda activate tt
    pip install transportation_tutorials

This re-install procedure should only need to be done once to download and install the files
in the `tt` conda environment, and then you'll have the files you need in te future.
